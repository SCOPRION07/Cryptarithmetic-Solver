# Cryptarithmetic-Solver
This project implements a **Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver** in Java. It takes three words representing an addition equation (e.g., `SEND + MORE = MONEY`) and attempts to find a digit substitution for each letter that satisfies the equation.

## âœ¨ Features

- Solves any cryptarithmetic addition problem with â‰¤10 unique letters.
- Handles leading zero constraints (e.g., no word can start with 0).
- Displays letter-to-digit mapping and formatted solution.
- Interactive input from the user.

## ðŸ§  What is Cryptarithmetic?

Cryptarithmetic (also known as verbal arithmetic or alphametics) is a type of mathematical puzzle in which the digits in an arithmetic expression are replaced by letters. The goal is to find a unique digit (0â€“9) for each letter such that the arithmetic operation holds true.
